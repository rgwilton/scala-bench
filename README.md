# scala-bench
Some benchmarks of memory and runtime performance of Scala's collections

Clone of Li Haoyi's version.

Moved to Scala 2.12.3 & sbt 1.0.
Increased work in tests to make array's a fairer comparision.
Changed results to be amortized per element (times should be nano-seconds).
Added some extra tests for updating arrays.
